# Deprocrastinator
People mostly students while studying or working get distracted by several social media sites and switch to them before completing their work(they procrastinate). So, i have developed a chrome extension (Deprocrastinator) which block several social media sites to help students study and people to not get distracted while working.
It blocks sites like, facebook, whatsapp, instagram, spotify, etc.
